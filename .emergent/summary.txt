The AI engineer's work trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to evolving the IL MANDORLA application from an MVP to a Super App and then integrating significant new functionalities. The initial phase focused on refining existing modules, particularly Agentes IA and Integraciones, alongside a major overhaul of the Recompensas section to implement the KumIA Stars Multilevel system. This involved extensive UI/UX enhancements, bug fixes, and backend considerations. A key challenge was resolving scope-related JavaScript errors in React components. Following the successful completion of the Recompensas section and extensive bug fixes in the ROI Viewer dashboard (which consumed significant budget), the focus shifted to a highly ambitious expansion. The current work involves adding five new, complex modules to the KumIA Dashboard, covering AI Marketing, Competitive Intelligence, Multiplayer Games, User Web App Management, and Financial Billing. The engineer is diligently adding new React components for these modules, preparing for their integration into the main dashboard navigation.

The IL MANDORLA Smokehouse dashboard, part of the KUMIA ELITE system, aims to centralize restaurant operations with features like secure Google OAuth2, real-time metrics, Menu, Reservations, Feedback, Rewards/NFTs, Client/Wallet management, and AI agent training, emphasizing a mobile-first UI. The Super App vision extends to a consumer-facing UserApp with AI customer service, Google Reviews integration, multiplayer games, and MercadoPago. A 100% AI marketing agency with specialized agents and an in-dashboard Gemini chat for business intelligence are crucial.

The Recompensas section was overhauled to display a tiered KumIA Stars Multilevel system (Descubridor to Leyenda) with associated Stars, Multipliers, and NFTs. It requires aggregated metrics, star generation logic (feedback, reservations, referrals), and administrative functions (view/export clients, analyze actions, manage reward types, add Recompensas Especiales). The design must be sober, digital, and progressive.

Recently, the ROI Viewer section received a complete redesign to provide clear, comparative, and actionable economic performance data for administrators. This includes a detailed ROI per level table (derived from Firestore data), average ticket evolution charts, real-time activity panels (Stars generated, conversion ratios, action rankings, NFTs, top clients), industry benchmark comparisons, a summary success indicator, and an interactive ROI simulation calculator.

The latest, most significant expansion involves adding five new hierarchical modules to the Dashboard:
1.  **AI Marketing Center:** For automated campaigns, intelligent segmentation, push notifications, A/B testing, and AI-powered video generation (Google Veo, RunwayML, Pika Labs).
2.  **Competitive Intelligence:** Benchmark comparisons, regional trends, competitor review scanning, and strategic recommendations.
3.  **Multiplayer Games:** Dashboard panel for activating and managing real-time, table-specific games for customers (single, pair, group player types) with both symbolic (KumiSmile) and real (KumIA) Star rewards. Features secure activation (QR/code+geolocation), session logic, and fraud detection.
4.  **User Web App Management:** Visual editor for the customer-facing WebApp (logo, colors, welcome message, rewards visibility), real-time previews, client wallet visualization, and AI-driven content.
5.  **KumIA Billing:** Monthly module summaries, electronic invoicing, payment history, dynamic ROI simulator, and plan updates.

<code_architecture>


-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The central FastAPI application managing API routes and business logic. It handles data fetching and updates for the various dashboard sections.
    -   **Changes Made**: Integrated Google Gemini API for KUMIA Business Intelligence chat. New endpoints are inferred to have been added or will be added to support the KumIA Stars system, ROI Viewer data, and the newly requested modules (AI Marketing, Competitive Intelligence, Games, WebApp Config, Billing).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores environment variables for backend services, including API keys.
    -   **Changes Made**:  was added. Expected to hold Firebase/Google Cloud credentials for KumIA Stars backend, and potentially API keys for new AI integrations (Google Veo, RunwayML, Pika Labs).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main React application file, holding core routes, state management, and overall layout of the KumIA Dashboard. It orchestrates which section is displayed based on navigation.
    -   **Changes Made**: The Dashboard section ( and ) was heavily refactored. Impacto generado por Kumia esta semana section moved below main cards. Expandir Kumia button made functional with a professional modal.  was updated to display a real line chart. This file is currently being updated to include the new navigation links and render the new components (CentroIAMarketing, InteligenciaCompetitiva, JuegosMultijugador, GestionUserWebApp, TuFacturacionKumIA) under their respective routes/sections.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Contains the majority of the React components, including sections for AI Agents, Integrations, Rewards/NFTs, and the ROI Viewer. This file is the primary recipient of new UI component implementations.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   ****: Completely refactored for the KumIA Stars Multilevel system. Tiered level cards, aggregate metrics, star logic explanation, and administrative functions (e.g., Análisis Completo, Configurar Sistema, Ver Clientes, Configurar level cards, Exportar Clientes por Nivel, Análisis de acciones por Nivel, Recompensas Especiales) were implemented, opening professional modals. Crucially, missing  handlers for + Agregar nueva recompensa and Ver Análisis detallado buttons were added, alongside their respective professional modals. A critical fix involved moving the  function's scope to be accessible within .
        -   ****: The entire component was completely redesigned and replaced to meet the new ROI Viewer requirements (detailed table, average ticket evolution chart, real-time activity panel, competitor benchmark, success indicator, simulation calculator).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed a high-priority task of overhauling and thoroughly debugging the ROI Viewer section of the Dashboard. This involved implementing a complex new design with a detailed ROI table, average ticket evolution chart, real-time activity panel, industry comparison, success indicator, and an interactive simulation calculator. Critical bug fixes were applied to ensure all filters (e.g., 7 dias, 30 dias, 60 dias, 90 dias), the Exportar Reporte button, and the interactive elements of the Evolución del ticket promedio chart (including data rendering and line display) are fully functional. The engineer declared the ROI Viewer section entirely resolved and production-ready.

Following this, the AI engineer received a new, extensive set of product requirements for PROMPT MAESTRO – NUEVAS SECCIONES DEL DASHBOARD KUMIA + USERWEBAPP GAMIFICADA. The current work involves the initial implementation phase for these five new dashboard modules. The engineer has begun by creating the React components for each of these modules in :
-    (Module 1)
-    (Module 2)
-    (Module 3)
-    (Module 4)
-    (Module 5)

Each component has been added with placeholder UI elements and initial structure as per the user's detailed functional requirements. The engineer is currently in the process of integrating these newly created components into the main dashboard navigation within , which is the immediate next step. The  module, in particular, is noted for its complexity due to the integrated security and gamification logic.
