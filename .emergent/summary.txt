The AI engineer's work transitioned from initial MVP enhancements to a significant expansion of the IL MANDORLA application. Initially, the focus was on perfecting Recompensas (KumIA Stars Multilevel) and extensively debugging the ROI Viewer. A pivotal shift occurred with the introduction of five new dashboard modules. The engineer systematically added these, ensuring their integration into the navigation and then comprehensively developed the AI Marketing Center, addressing detailed user feedback. This involved complex UI/UX updates, backend API development for content generation, and robust testing. The current phase has successfully completed the Multiplayer Games section, addressing initial functional gaps, and is now poised to tackle the User Web App Management module, leveraging an external repository for context.

The IL MANDORLA Smokehouse dashboard, part of the KUMIA ELITE system, centralizes restaurant operations, emphasizing a mobile-first UI. Core features include Google OAuth2, real-time metrics, Menu, Reservations, Feedback, Rewards/NFTs (KumIA Stars Multilevel system with tiered levels, stars, multipliers, and administrative functions), Client/Wallet management, and AI agent training. The Super App vision extends to a consumer-facing UserApp with AI customer service, Google Reviews integration, multiplayer games, and MercadoPago. A 100% AI marketing agency with specialized agents and an in-dashboard Gemini chat for business intelligence are crucial.

The ROI Viewer section was redesigned for clear economic performance data, including a detailed ROI table, average ticket evolution, real-time activity, industry benchmarks, and an ROI simulation calculator.

The latest expansion involves five new dashboard modules:
1.  **AI Marketing Center:** Automated campaigns, intelligent segmentation, push notifications, A/B testing, and AI-powered video/image generation (Google Veo, RunwayML, Pika Labs) with cost tracking, previews, editing, and publishing options.
2.  **Competitive Intelligence:** Benchmark comparisons, regional trends, competitor review scanning, and strategic recommendations.
3.  **Multiplayer Games:** Dashboard panel for activating/managing real-time, table-specific games for customers, with secure activation, session logic, and fraud detection, offering symbolic and real Star rewards.
4.  **User Web App Management:** Visual editor for the customer-facing WebApp (logo, colors, welcome message, rewards visibility), real-time previews, client wallet visualization, and AI-driven content.
5.  **KumIA Billing:** Monthly module summaries, electronic invoicing, payment history, dynamic ROI simulator, and plan updates.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the comprehensive overhaul and debugging of the ROI Viewer section. Subsequently, the focus shifted to integrating five new dashboard modules. The initial phase involved creating placeholder React components (, , , , ) in  and integrating them into the main navigation ().

The most significant recent effort involved a detailed implementation of all user-requested enhancements for the Centro de IA Marketing section. This included:
1.  **Frontend (AppComponents.js):** Full implementation of Fábrica de Contenido - Generador de Videos (with video description, AI model selection, cost calculation, credit system, preview, and simulated generation), Fábrica de Contenido - Generador de Imágenes, Nueva Campaña Personalizada (including Instagram channel), functional Activar Campaña, Editar and Desactivar buttons for suggested campaigns, improved Push Automáticos with customizability, and functional modals for Publicar, Créditos, and Nueva Prueba A/B.
2.  **Backend (server.py & requirements.txt):** Addition of new FastAPI endpoints for content generation (video and image) and segmented campaigns, along with necessary Python library installations (, , ).

The Centro de IA Marketing section has been fully translated to Spanish and verified via screenshots, showing all functionalities implemented, and backend testing confirmed all related endpoints are working.

The work has now transitioned to the Juegos Multijugador and Gestión de User Web App sections. The AI engineer has successfully implemented the requested improvements for Juegos Multijugador including making the Configuración de Juegos and UserWebApp Preview buttons functional, enabling configuration and preview for individual games, allowing modification of reward limits (max 2 real stars per session), and making the Panel de Seguridad editable. The engineer has explicitly stated that the Juegos Multijugador section is complete and working correctly. The next immediate task is addressing the Gestión de User Web App section, for which the engineer has already examined an external GitHub repository for structural understanding.
