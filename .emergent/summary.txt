The AI engineer successfully transitioned the IL MANDORLA application, initially from MVP to Super App, by refining existing modules and implementing new features. A significant portion of the work involved enhancing the Agentes IA section with specialized AI agents and integrating an in-dashboard Gemini chat. The engineer also evolved the Integraciones section to include a comprehensive ERP integration with detailed synchronization options and improved UI/UX. The development process was highly iterative, driven by extensive user feedback. Recently, the focus shifted to a complete overhaul of the Recompensas section, implementing a detailed KumIA Stars Multilevel system with tiered levels, metrics, administrative functions, and a complex Star logic. This involved numerous frontend UI/UX enhancements and bug fixes, including dynamic charts and professional modals, as well as initial backend considerations. The latest iterations primarily addressed user-reported bugs and UI/UX refinements in both the Dashboard and Rewards sections.

The IL MANDORLA Smokehouse dashboard, part of the KUMIA ELITE system, aims to centralize restaurant operations. Core features include secure Google OAuth2, real-time metrics, comprehensive Menu, Reservations, Feedback, Rewards/NFTs, Client/Wallet management, and AI agent training, all with a mobile-first UI. The Super App vision extends this to a consumer-facing UserApp with AI-powered customer service, Google Reviews integration, multiplayer games, and MercadoPago. A key component is a 100% AI marketing agency with specialized AI agents. An in-dashboard Gemini chat for business intelligence is crucial.

The Recompensas section overhaul requires displaying a tiered KumIA Stars Multilevel system (Descubridor, Explorador, Destacado, Estrella, Leyenda) with associated Stars, Multipliers, and unique NFTs. It must show aggregated metrics (Total Stars, Rewards Redeemed, Most Frequent Level, NFT most unlocked, Active Referrals) and explain the underlying logic (Star generation from feedback, reservations, referrals; multiplier application; level/NFT unlocks; non-loss of level on redemption). Administrative functionality is needed to view/export clients by level/NFT, analyze frequent actions, activate/deactivate reward types, and add Recompensas Especiales. The design should be sober, digital, and progressive, aligning with KumIA branding. A detailed Star value and redemption logic, with a 60-day redemption limit and level-up resets, is specified.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on addressing a new round of user feedback and bug fixes for the recently implemented Recompensas section and the main Dashboard.

For the **Dashboard**:
The layout was reorganized, specifically moving the Impacto generado por Kumia esta semana section below the main metrics cards. The Expandir Kumia button, which was duplicated and non-functional, has been fixed; it now opens a professional modal detailing expansion analysis, steps, and investment plans. The Crecimiento semanal de ingresos section, previously lacking a proper visual, was enhanced with a professional line growth chart displaying real data and interactive points.

For the **Recompensas section**:
The Ver Clientes and Configurar buttons on the level cards, which the user reported as still not professionally functional or editable, were updated to open comprehensive, professional modals. The Ver Clientes modal now displays a detailed client list with search/filter capabilities, and export/email campaign buttons. The Configurar modal provides a full editing interface for level management. The Feedback con video option was restored in the Configuración de Generación de Stars. The Análisis de acción por Nivel button was fixed to open a professional analytics dashboard. Additionally, new modals for Email and WhatsApp campaign setup were added, triggered by their respective buttons within the Ver Clientes modal.

The last action taken was implementing improvements for the + Agregar nueva recompensa and Ver Análisis detallado buttons within the Configurar modal of the Rewards section.
