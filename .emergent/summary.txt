The AI engineer successfully transitioned the IL MANDORLA dashboard from MVP to a comprehensive application, then pivoted to building a Super App ecosystem. Initial work focused on fixing UI/UX bugs in existing modules like Reporte Semanal and Crecimiento Semanal de Ingresos, adding interactive charts and export. A major focus was the new Reservas system, including real-time table management, automated confirmations, and integrating a separate Next.js UserWebApp via a shared Firebase backend. The AI engineer also resolved Google OAuth  issues. Subsequent efforts involved completely revamping the Menu section (full CRUD, analytics, image/video uploads), enhancing the Clientes section with diverse data and functional action buttons/modals (NFTs, history, referrals), and integrating Google Reviews as a primary channel in the Feedback section with automated responses. The current task is transforming the Agentes IA section into a full AI marketing agency, replacing generic assistants with specialized agents, and implementing an in-dashboard Gemini chat. The immediate action is adding modals for agent functionalities.

<product_requirements>
The IL MANDORLA Smokehouse dashboard, part of the KUMIA ELITE system, centralizes restaurant operations. Core requirements included secure Google OAuth2, real-time metrics, menu, reservations, feedback, rewards/NFTs, client/wallet, and AI agent training, all with a mobile-first UI focused on ROI and AI-driven insights. The Menu module specifically needed full restoration with upselling features. The expanded vision introduces a Super App ecosystem, connecting this admin dashboard with a separate UserApp for consumers. This involves fully AI-powered customer service, Google Reviews integration with gamified rewards, multiplayer games, and in-app payment processing (MercadoPago). The platform's revenue model is based on restaurant subscriptions and transaction fees, without consumer charges. A key focus is a 100% AI marketing agency, where specialized AI agents manage all digital channels, responding to comments, DMs, and reviews, replacing human community managers. An in-dashboard Gemini chat is required for business intelligence, guiding owners on prompt modification, analytics, and strategic decisions based on dashboard data.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was focused on transforming the Agentes IA (AI Agents) section within the dashboard. The user explicitly requested to make all action buttons fully functional, including: Reporte de Rendimiento, + Nuevo Agente, Probar, Entrenar, Clonar, and Analizar. The AI engineer confirmed the task to implement these 6 missing modals.

The AI Agents section has already undergone a significant transformation:
-   Generic WhatsApp Assistant duplicates were replaced by 8 specialized AI agents (e.g., Google Reviews Manager, WhatsApp Concierge IA, IA Garzon Virtual, KUMIA Loyalty IA).
-   Advanced metrics for AI performance are displayed.
-   An in-dashboard Gemini chat (ðŸ§  KUMIA Business IA) is implemented, designed for business intelligence and strategic guidance using dashboard data.
-   The Centro de Entrenamiento has been improved, showing active data sources and agent performance.

The current, precise state is that the code for these remaining modals has just been added (likely within  due to its length), and the next immediate step is to restart the frontend to apply these changes. The AI Agents section is intended to be the heart of your operation 100% automatizada, replacing human community managers.
