The AI engineer successfully took over the project to evolve a React-FastAPI-MongoDB application from an MVP state. The approach involved a systematic exploration of the existing codebase, primarily focusing on  and  which contained the core UI logic. The engineer adopted an iterative development cycle, confirming requirements, implementing features incrementally, and providing frequent progress updates. Key decisions included using local storage for the 90-day title restriction and prioritizing UI/functional improvements before deeper backend integrations for AI agents and competitive intelligence. The work delivered a significant expansion of the application's dashboard, making several previously static or non-functional sections interactive and dynamic. The project is currently in a bug-fixing phase, addressing issues reported by the user regarding button functionality in the Juegos Multijugador and Gestión Garzón WebApp sections.

<product_requirements>
The user aims to enhance an existing Dashboard application (part of the KumIA product suite, which includes Dashboard, ConsumerWebApp, and GarzonWebApp). The core problem is to transform a static MVP into a fully functional, customizable, and scalable product ready for sale and future integration with AI agents.

**Implemented Product Features:**
1.  **Dynamic Branding:** Business owners can edit the dashboard title (originally IL MANDORLA) once every 90 days and upload/display their logo. The subtitle Sistema KumIA Elite has been changed to Powered by KumIA Technology.
2.  **Menu Category Management:** A new + nueva categoria button in the Menu section allows customizable categories (add, edit, remove, duplicate).
3.  **Gestión Garzón WebApp (formerly Gestión User webApp):**
    *   Renamed section for managing waiters.
    *   Business owners can add/remove waiters, modify working periods (Seleccionar turno, modificar turnos).
    *   Provides performance insights: detailed metrics per garzón (Time, Quality, Sales, Activity, Performance, Alerts, Export Report, Suggested improvement), global metrics, and performance ranking.
    *   Includes an incentives system for bonuses and rewards.
    *   The Gestión de Módulos sidebar was moved to a horizontal menu.
    *   Ver detalles and Gestionar Turnos buttons are functional.
4.  **ROI Indicator:** The ROI +4.3x indicator now has an update button and a Hace 24 horas timestamp, with real-time update functionality.
5.  **Expandir KumIA Buttons:** These buttons (Abrir Nuevo Local) have been restyled to white, making them less prominent.
6.  **Tu Facturación KumIA (Billing):** The + agregar método and Actualizar datos buttons in the payment methods section are now functional, with associated modals.
7.  **Inteligencia Competitiva:** Análisis detallado, Tendencias IA, and Actualizar Datos buttons are functional.
8.  **Agentes IA:** A delete button for agents has been added, along with a ¿Cómo funciona? button for explanations.
9.  **Juegos Multijugador:** Basic functionality has been added for Sudoku (3 levels), Pac-Man (3 difficulties), and Crucigrama (5 levels), with Jugar buttons and a game modal.

**Future Considerations (Discussed but not implemented):**
*   **Smart Tip Distribution System:** Proposed feature for fair tip distribution among all restaurant roles.
*   **Feedback Section:** Integration with WhatsApp Business API, Instagram Direct Messages, and Email automation for feedback collection (beyond Google Reviews).
*   **AI Agents Realism:** Deep integration with Google's Gemini Pro API and Meta APIs (WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook Business API) for agent training (Vertex AI fine-tuning, RAG) and operation.
*   **Competitive Intelligence Tools:** Specific web scraping tools (Apify, SerpApi, ScrapingBee) and social media APIs (Instagram Basic Display, Facebook Graph, Google My Business) discussed, potentially with non-Google AI models (OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude) for sentiment/detailed analysis.
*   **Roles and Permissions:** Functionality for editing, creating, and deleting roles.

The application has a standard full-stack structure:


**Directory Structure (Relevant parts):**


**Key Files and Modifications:**

-   ****:
    *   **Importance:** This is the main React application file, responsible for overall layout, routing, global state management, and orchestrating major components. It defines the  component,  component, and manages .
    *   **Changes Made:**
        *   Introduced  hooks for , , ,  to manage dynamic branding.
        *   Modified the  component to pass these states and update functions to .
        *   Updated the header to display the dynamic  and .
        *   Modified the  component to use dynamic branding (e.g., Powered by KumIA Technology subtitle).
        *   Implemented category management within the : added a + nueva categoria button, new state variables (, , ), and functions (, , , ) with associated modals.
        *   Updated the ROI indicator ( state) to include an update button and last update timestamp.
        *   Modified the styling of Expandir KumIA buttons to be white.

The backend () was tested but no explicit code modifications within the trajectory were described by the AI engineer, implying that the focus was primarily on frontend UI and functionality based on the user's initial request to ensure frontend responsiveness and functionality. The backend is configured to use  and expose API routes prefixed with .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a bug report from the user. The user reported that the Jugar buttons in the Juegos Multijugador section and the various buttons (e.g., Ver detalles, Gestionar Turnos, remove) in the Gestión Garzón WebApp section were not functioning as expected.

The engineer acknowledged the bug and initiated a debugging process. The last recorded action was taking a screenshot of the frontend to visually verify the state of the buttons and then stating the intent to revisar el código para encontrar los problemas específicos, indicating a code-level investigation into why the button click events are not triggering the intended functions. This implies that while the UI elements are present and clickable, the underlying JavaScript logic or state updates are not correctly propagating or being handled. The current focus is on diagnosing and fixing these specific functional issues to ensure the previously implemented features are fully operational.

<optional_next_step>
I will investigate the code for Juegos Multijugador and Gestión Garzón WebApp buttons to identify and fix the non-functional issues.
