The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned an MVP React-FastAPI-MongoDB application towards a fully functional state. The development primarily focused on frontend UI and functionality within  and . The approach was iterative, involving feature implementation, frequent user confirmation, and subsequent bug fixing. Key work included dynamic branding, menu management, activating various dashboard sections like Tu Facturacion KumIA and Inteligencia Competitiva, and implementing basic Juegos Multijugador functionality. The recent work involved critical bug fixes for non-functional buttons in Juegos Multijugador and Gestión Garzón WebApp, which were largely resolved. Following this, the user pivoted to a comprehensive documentation task for the entire system, with a strong emphasis on Google Partner-first AI agent architecture. The engineer generated several documentation files but faced an issue while attempting to complete the  file due to an incorrect  command. A minor bug in Gestionar Turnos button functionality in  also remains.

The goal is to evolve a static MVP Dashboard application, part of the KumIA product suite, into a customizable, scalable product ready for sale and future AI integration. The problem involves enhancing existing features and adding new ones to provide a comprehensive management solution for business owners, prioritizing a Google-first integration strategy for future AI agents.

**Implemented Product Features:**
1.  **Dynamic Branding:** Editable dashboard title (90-day restriction), logo upload, and Powered by KumIA Technology subtitle.
2.  **Menu Category Management:** + nueva categoria button enables adding, editing, removing, and duplicating categories.
3.  **Gestión Garzón WebApp:** Renamed section for managing waiters, including adding/removing, modifying shifts, performance insights (detailed, global, ranking), and an incentives system. Ver detalles and Gestionar Turnos buttons are functional (with one minor pending issue for Gestionar Turnos). Remove functionality is implemented.
4.  **ROI Indicator:** ROI +4.3x now has an update button and timestamp with real-time functionality.
5.  **Expandir KumIA Buttons:** Restyled to white.

The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:



**Directory Structure (Relevant parts):**


**Key Files and Modifications:**

-   ****:
    *   **Importance:** Acts as the primary application entry point, managing overall layout, routing, and global states.
    *   **Changes Made:**
        *   Incorporated  hooks for dynamic , , ,  for branding.
        *   Updated the  and  components to utilize and pass these dynamic branding states.
        *   Introduced category management state (, , ) and handlers within .
        *   Modified ROI indicator ( state) with update button and timestamp.
        *   Restyled Expandir KumIA buttons to white.

-   ****:
    *   **Importance:** Houses various reusable UI components and dashboard sections, encapsulating their specific logic and rendering. This file received the most significant updates.
    *   **Changes Made:**
        *   **:** Enhanced with editable restaurant title (90-day restriction) and logo upload (Base64 encoding).
        *   **:** Completely redesigned to include a horizontal menu, detailed sub-sections (Gestión de Equipo, Métricas Globales, etc.).
            *   **Crucial Fixes**: Updated the  handler for Ver Detalles button (line 15204).
            *   **Added three new modals**: , , and  at the end of the  component, providing detailed waiter information, shift management, and waiter removal confirmation.
        *   **:** Activated payment method buttons (, ) with modals.
        *   **:** Activated Análisis detallado, Tendencias IA, and Actualizar Datos buttons.
        *   **:** Added Eliminar and ¿Cómo funciona? buttons.
        *   **:** Implemented basic game components.
            *   **Crucial Fixes**: Added the  (game modal with Sudoku, Pac-Man, Crucigrama interfaces) directly within the  component, which was previously missing or misplaced, enabling the JUGAR! buttons to function correctly. The , , and  functions were confirmed to exist and be correctly wired.

-   ****:
    *   **Importance:** FastAPI backend handling API requests and MongoDB interactions.
    *   **Changes Made:** No explicit code modifications were described in the trajectory, implying the focus was solely on frontend. It adheres to  prefix for routes and uses .

**New Documentation Files Created:**
-   ****: Master technical documentation.
-   ****: Detailed implementation guide for AI agents (currently incomplete, only one agent fully detailed).
-   ****: Comprehensive API integration specifications for Google services.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with providing comprehensive documentation for the KumIA Dashboard system, with a strong emphasis on a Google Partner-first approach for AI agents.

The engineer successfully generated four markdown documentation files:
1.  
2.  
3.  
4.  

These documents detail the system architecture, Google API integrations, implementation guides for AI agents, and a development roadmap.

However, the user pointed out that the  file was incomplete, as it only detailed one of the twelve AI agents mentioned. The user explicitly requested to complete this document for all agents.

The AI engineer acknowledged this and attempted to update  to include all 12 agents, but the last action resulted in a  error during the  attempt (Chat Message 117). This means the documentation completion task is currently stuck at this point.

Additionally, during the previous bug-fixing phase, while the Juegos Multijugador and Ver Detalles buttons in Gestión Garzón WebApp were confirmed as fully functional, the Gestionar Turnos button in Gestión Garzón WebApp was noted as 95% functional and still not opening its modal correctly, suggesting a minor remaining bug that needs refinement.

<optional_next_step>
My next step is to correctly complete the  file to detail all 12 AI agents as requested by the user.
